<h2>What?</h2>
<p>
"Vietnamese Spelling Wizard" is my team's application of FPT.AI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) API. We won the First Prize in the FTI Growth Hacking Challenge 2020. 
</p>
<p>
TTS service enables developers to synthesize natural-sounding Vietnamese speech with a wide range of voice (male, female) and Vietnamese accents (Northern, Middle and Southern accent). The service is accessible in the form of APIs that is able to integrate easily with any system, across many applications and devices.
</p>
<p>
Our product -- Vietnamese Spelling Wizard (or BeDanhVan) --  is an application utilizing TTS to assist kids (age range 3-8) in recognizing, spelling, and pronunciating Vietnamese words. The package includes animated flashcards and sound along with fairytales, games for kids to truly have an amazing time learning.
