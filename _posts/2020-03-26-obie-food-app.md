<h2>What?</h2>
<p>
	Obie Food is our team's pitch for the Startup Weekend Competition. It is an app-based food delivery service at Oberlin. 
</p>
<p>
	My team had 3 people. My task was to <b>develop</b> the <b>User Interface (UI)</b> for the <b>Mininum Viable Product (MVP)</b> model for an <b>Android App</b> using <b>Android Studio</b>. 
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
	Our purpose was to come up with a convenient and affordable platform for Oberlin residents to order food without having to pay a 30% mark-up and expensive delivery fee. Hence, the solution is a mobile app run by Oberlin students. Our app also has a delivery tracking system for Obies to order food at ease!

<h2>How?</h2>
<p>
	I used Android Studio for the first time to build the MVP model. The model has 4 pages representing the 4 primary functions of the app:
